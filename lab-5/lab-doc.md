## Introduction

In this lab we will look at Numerical Integration. All work will be done in the notebook.

## Todo:

- A worked example of:
  - Symbolic Integration and Computing Definite Integrals
  - The Midpoint Rule
  - The Trapezoidal Rule
  - Simpson's Rule
- Warm up: Polynomial Class and Symbolic Integration

## Example Files

`pre-lab.ipynb' - the starter code for the pre-lab
`assn-starter.ipynb` - the starter code for the assignment

## Assignment

Complete the assignment notebook:
- Part 1: Implement the Polynomial class, which implements:
  - Symbolic Integration
  - Computing Exact Definite Integrals
  - The Midpoint Rule
  - The Trapezoidal Rule
  - Simpson's Rule
- Part 2: Comparison and Exploration
  - Compare the different methods, in terms of performance
- Part 3: Real-world example
  - Solve a real-world problem with 1D kinematics and a model rocket

## Submission

Please submit your `.ipynb` file to UR Courses by the due date.
