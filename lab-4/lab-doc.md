## Introduction

In this lab we will look at LU Decomposition. All work will be done in the notebook.

## Todo:
- A fully worked example
- Warm up: Lists in Python
- Starter Code

## Example Files

`eg-starter.ipynb` - the starter code for the prelab 
`assn-starter.ipynb` - the completed code for the prelab, and the starter code for the assignment

## Assignment

- complete the assignment notebook
- Part 1: Complete the polynomial class, including all three root solvers
- Part 2: Benchmark the root solvers and find the roots of a new polynomial
- Part 3: Solve a real world problem

## Submission

Please submit your `.ipynb` file to UR Courses by the due date.
