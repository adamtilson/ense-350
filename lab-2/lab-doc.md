## Introduction

In this lab we will be implementing the RSA Algorithm. This is a public key encryption method in which a sender can encrypt a message using a public key, and the reciever can decrypt the message using a private key. We will work through a complete example together of the system, and also look at some object-oriented programming in python, exception handling and working with lists.

## Example Notebook

We will work through the example notebook
- eg-start is the starter code for the pre-lab. Fill this in as we go
- eg-complete is the finished pre-lab code. You can refer to this if you fall behind.
- assn-starter is the starter code for the lab-assignment

## Math concept review and examples:

Let's do a full example of RSA

## Assignment

- complete the assignment notebook
 
- Part 1: Add some utility classes from Lab 1
- Part 2: Implement the RSA Key Generator
- Part 3: Implement the Sender (Encrypt) and Reciever (Decrypt) classes
- Part 4: Test the algorithm on a real world encryption and decryption task

You are not allowed to use any libraries outside of core Python 3, e.g. numpy. You are also not allowed to use the `pow` function in your final code, though you can use it for testing to help debug errors. 

## Submission

Please submit your `.ipynb` file to UR Courses by the due date.
